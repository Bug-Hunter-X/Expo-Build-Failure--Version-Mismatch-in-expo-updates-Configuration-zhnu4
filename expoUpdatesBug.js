While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the expo-updates package. The error message was vague and didn't pinpoint the exact cause. After checking the expo-updates configuration and the build process, I discovered that the issue was related to incorrect versioning in the expo-updates configuration. The version numbers in app.json and the expo-updates configuration weren't in sync, causing the build to fail.
