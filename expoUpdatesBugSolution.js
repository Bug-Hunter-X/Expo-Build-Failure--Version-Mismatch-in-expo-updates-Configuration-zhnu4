The solution involves carefully reviewing and synchronizing the version numbers specified in the app.json file and within the expo-updates configuration.  Ensure that the version numbers are consistent.  In my case, I updated the version number in app.json to match the latest published version in the expo-updates configuration.  Furthermore, ensure that there are no extra spaces or other formatting inconsistencies.  Cleaning the project and performing a fresh build helped in resolving the issue.  A clean build process can help to eliminate other potential build problems as well.
